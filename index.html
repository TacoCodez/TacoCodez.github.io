    <h1>This is TacoTerminals little website. For now, just look at the endings and searches for the DOOR PC [DEMO]</h1>
    <h2>Searches (Go to Doors Explorer. Some searches lead to endings!)</h2>
    <p>Something</p>
    <p>Fortnite (I had to, but its a troll and its kinda funny.)</p>
    <p>Ending</p>
    <p>Rickroll or Troll or Meme or Memes (all lead to same thing.)</p>
    <p>Scream (Headphone Warning)</p>
    <p>Random Level Generator Reamastered</p>
    <h2>Endings NOT in Doors Explorer</h2>
